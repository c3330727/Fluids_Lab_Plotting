# Fluids_Lab_Plotting

This is the code I have done for the Fluids Lab.

I have added both the data files in the form of the excel files.
These file will have both raw data and calculations for coefficients and ect.

The code won't work unless you change the path to the excel files.

I haven't included the graphs in this repository for cleanliness.
